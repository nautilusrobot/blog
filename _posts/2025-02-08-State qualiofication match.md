The day has finally come! This is the second round of the competition, and the winner will advance to compete at the state level in Ohio. 
We’ve already achieved our initial goal as first-year participants, and we are so excited to meet so many other teams. It’s a bit intimidating since most of the other teams are made up of middle schoolers.

Everyone seems to be as nervous as we are. The practice tables are always crowded, so we need to reserve one soon!

A big thank you to our coaches for taking these photos for us. We are so focused on the match that we hardly noticed our surroundings. Unfortunately, our team didn’t make it to the state-level competition. :-(

That said, I have to admit that this experience has exceeded my expectations! I’ve learned a lot—not only about coding but also about collaborating with others who share the same goals.
