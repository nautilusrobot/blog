Coach Wei has preapreed a lot of coding Materials for us. I feel like most of us are more intertested to build all the missions. (things we can touch, haha)

We need to decide and finalize our team name and team logo quickly. I have already heard so many names. We may need to vote to pick up one.

May the best name win!!!
