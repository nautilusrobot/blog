Our team interviewed with **Dr Yeping Yuan, Associate Professor of Ocean Science, Zhejiang University**

Notes are capuretred by our team member Abert.


What are your most pressing concerns regarding the long-term effects of oil
spills on coastal ecosystems?


> How does biodiversity change in coastal ecosystem after a long-term impact from oil spills?
> Which trophic levels in marine life would be mostly affected, and how would this affect
> the ecosystem functions?


What are the biggest challenges you face in studying and solving for
the impacts of oil spills on marine life and habitats?

> * Since some effect from oil spills on marine life or ecosystem would be chronic and not be
> observed immediately, the continuously monitoring should be conducted, which would be
> a challenge.
> * Oil is hardly to be degraded and toxic to marine life. The chemical compounds of oil is
> complex, and we know little about their toxicity. So, it would be a challenge to evaluate
> their impact on marine life and habitats.


Are there any emerging technologies or research areas that you believe
could significantly improve oil spill response and recovery efforts?

> * The in-situ observation technology should be developed for monitoring the dispersal
> pathway of oil in seawater. The observation system also carries the camera which has high
> resolution to capture the consumption of oil by marine organisms.
> * We should also conduct research on genetic response of marine organisms to oil spill to
> figure out how physiological, genetic and evolutionary response of marine life to oil spill.


How can our team "Nautilus" contribute to fostering greater
collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and industry in addressing the challenges posed
by oil spills? What specific roles or projects could we undertake to facilitate partnerships and
knowledge sharing while being realistic?

>  The team Nautilus could go and find scientists in this study field and know what currently
> they are working on the solution of oil spill. Meanwhile, it can also consult with
> policymakers for understanding what they need from scientists.


What strategies do you think are most effective for raising public
awareness about the dangers of oil spills and promoting sustainable practices? What specific
roles or projects could we undertake to support such initiatives while being realistic?

> * It would be great to go to schools and communities for publicizing the dangers of oil spills
>based on the scientific research results.
> * I don’t really have any specific role in my mind that you can undertake in such initiatives,
> but I do believe that it will be great when we have more people being involved in protecting
> our ocean.


do you have any suggestions or ideas in mind as solutions to this problem?


> * To solve the oil spills problem, I think the most important point is to understand the long-
> term impact to the ecosystem.
> * You can refer to one project I’ve been involved in, ECOGIG, which was initiated after the
> Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010: https://ecogig.org/. The scientists have made great
> effort to solve the problem but you can definitely contribute more with your new insights.
