## Why it is so important

Oil spills can occur during extraction, transportation, or when oil-based products spill directly into waterways or from inland storm drains. It is a global issue, with an estimated 1.3 million gallons of oil spilled every year. These spills cause direct harm to animals and ecosystems. Animals may suffer from both direct exposure to the oil and its secondary effects. 

Additionally, their habitats are destroyed, leading to recovery times that can last decades. Oil spills also impact local economies and the communities living nearby, resulting in long-term devastation. 

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 is a notable example, with an estimated total discharge of 4.9 million barrels (approximately 210 million gallons). Even a decade later, the community and animal habitats affected by this disaster have yet to fully recover.

### Common industry pratices
The common oil spill responses are:

* Chemical dispersion and biological agents:  break down the oil into its chemical constituents
* Buring: aims to remove oils floating on the water
* Natural Dispersal. (oil eventually break down if left alone)

### Our Objectives

In addition to bring more awareness of the harms and impacts of oil spill, we also want to 

* Design a new cost-effective apporach to clean up oil without secondary damage 
* Design a new continuious oil recycling on the ocean
* Collect and establish baseline data and access long-term impact

## The Big Idea

We all know sponge can absorbing, it can be reuse again and again. The idea is to find a material capable of absorbing oil exclusively from water to create a "Super Sponge".  
If such matieral can be found and produced, it could be a game changer for mitigating Oil spills. These are qualities that we are looking for:

* High oil absorption capacity
* Reusability
* Won't case any secondary pollution
* Cost

Next we need to design a continuious recycleing mecanisim to keep these sponges into action. One small sponge can only do so much, but with the right volumn it surely will make a big difference. 
We want to make it as simple as possible to reduce the installion or maintaince cost. Ideally it should be automated so the design will be depolyed without much human intervaetion.
This is also our team's strenths: develop and create a model which can fully unilize the oil absorbing matieral.

### What do the Experts say

### Our experiment and module

Based on the feedbacks from the experts, we finalized three different materials for our own experiment. 

* Polypropylene: Polypropylene (PP), also known as polypropene, is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications. It is produced via chain-growth polymerization from the monomer propylene.

* Polyester: Polyester is a category of polymers that contain one or two ester linkages in every repeat unit of their main chain.

* Micelle: A micelle is an aggregate (or supramolecular assembly) of surfactant amphipathic lipid molecules dispersed in a liquid, forming a colloidal suspension (also known as associated colloidal system).

We place these oil absorbing & hydrophobic material with using engine oil, vegetable oil, crude oil, mixing with tap water. 
All of the matierals did decent work absorbing only oil and the filted water visually looks clear. The engineered polyester stands out and quickly clean up the oil ( > 50 w/w) within 10 mins.

After the experiment, our team start designing the recycle model which untiliz the engineered polyester belt.
Our idea comes from the tank belt. The rouating mecanisim allows the materials to be installed indiviually. At the end of the device, it has a second roller to phyically push the oil out of the material.

This device can continously recycle oil. It can be installed on boat, floting platform or any other stable flat surfaces. The absorbent belt cost only $10/KG and it can be reused up to 10 times until it show decrease of performance.


### Let's talk about the advantages

* The matieral is safe for env and human. it won't cause any secondary pollution.
* The matieral can be recoveried and recycled easily. 
* The oil can be recollected and hopfully reused.
* The kit is suitable for any existing oil platform or clean up ship. 

## Next Step

* Enhance roubustness and capacity of absorbent belt
* Improve gyro motor to increase oil recycle efficiency.
* Applyfor patent protection, contract manufacture and commercialize products.
