## Why it is so important

Oil spills can occur during extraction, transportation, or when oil-based products spill directly into waterways or from inland storm drains. It is a global issue, with an estimated 1.3 million gallons of oil spilled every year. These spills cause direct harm to animals and ecosystems. Animals may suffer from both direct exposure to the oil and its secondary effects. 

Additionally, their habitats are destroyed, leading to recovery times that can last decades. Oil spills also impact local economies and the communities living nearby, resulting in long-term devastation. 

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 is a notable example, with an estimated total discharge of 4.9 million barrels (approximately 210 million gallons). Even a decade later, the community and animal habitats affected by this disaster have yet to fully recover.

Our team conducted the research in the libarary and online. We also reach out to expert to understand the pressing need and impact of the oil spills.

### Common industry pratices
The common oil spill responses are:

* Chemical dispersion and biological agents:  break down the oil into its chemical constituents
* Buring: aims to remove oils floating on the water
* Natural Dispersal. (oil eventually break down if left alone)

### Our Objectives

In addition to bring more awareness of the harms and impacts of oil spill, we also want to 

* Design a new cost-effective apporach to clean up oil without secondary damage 
* Design a new continuious oil recycling on the ocean
* Collect and establish baseline data and access long-term impact

## The Big Idea

We all know that sponges can absorb liquid and can be reused multiple times. The goal is to find a material capable of absorbing oil exclusively from water to create a "Super Sponge." 
If such a material can be discovered and produced, it could be a game changer in mitigating oil spills. Here are the qualities we are looking for:

* High oil absorption capacity
* Reusability
* Won't case any secondary pollution
* Cost

Next, we need to design a continuous recycling mechanism to keep these sponges functioning effectively. While a single sponge has its limitations, an adequate volume can certainly make a significant impact. 
Our goal is to make the system as simple as possible to minimize installation and maintenance costs. Ideally, it should be automated to enable deployment with minimal human intervention. 
This aligns with our team's strengths: developing and creating a model that can fully utilize the oil-absorbing material.



### Our experiment and module

We reached out to the experts. Based on their feedbackss, we finalized three different materials for our own experiment. 

* Polypropylene: Polypropylene (PP), also known as polypropene, is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications. It is produced via chain-growth polymerization from the monomer propylene.

* Polyester: Polyester is a category of polymers that contain one or two ester linkages in every repeat unit of their main chain.

* Micelle: A micelle is an aggregate (or supramolecular assembly) of surfactant amphipathic lipid molecules dispersed in a liquid, forming a colloidal suspension (also known as associated colloidal system).

We placed these oil-absorbing and hydrophobic materials in contact with engine oil, vegetable oil, crude oil, and tap water. All of the materials performed reasonably well at absorbing only oil, and the filtered water appeared visually clear. 
The engineered polyester stood out, effectively cleaning up over 50% weight/weight of the oil within 10 minutes.

After the experiment, our team began designing a recycling model that utilizes the engineered polyester belt. 
Our concept is inspired by the tank belt. The rotating mechanism allows for the individual installation of materials. At the end of the device, there is a second roller that physically pushes the oil out of the material.

This device can continuously recycle oil and can be installed on boats, floating platforms, or any other stable, flat surfaces. The absorbent belt costs only $10 per kilogram and can be reused up to 10 times before its performance starts to decline.

We built the lego version of the model based on our design. We also confirm with Dr. Dean Wang (Mechanical Engineering, OSU) to make sure this will works in real world.

### Let's talk about the advantages

* The material is safe for both the environment and human health, ensuring that it does not lead to any secondary pollution.  
* The material is easily recoverable and recyclable, promoting sustainability.  
* The oil can be collected and ideally reused, maximizing resource efficiency.  
* This kit is compatible with any existing oil platform or cleanup vessel, making it versatile for various applications.  

## Next Step

* Enhance roubustness and capacity of absorbent belt
* Improve gyro motor to increase oil recycle efficiency.
* Applyfor patent protection, contract manufacture and commercialize products.
