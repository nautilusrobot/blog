## Why it is so important

Oil spills can occur during extraction, transportation, or when oil-based products spill directly into waterways or from inland storm drains. It is a global issue, with an estimated 1.3 million gallons of oil spilled every year. These spills cause direct harm to animals and ecosystems. Animals may suffer from both direct exposure to the oil and its secondary effects. 

Additionally, their habitats are destroyed, leading to recovery times that can last decades. Oil spills also impact local economies and the communities living nearby, resulting in long-term devastation. 

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 is a notable example, with an estimated total discharge of 4.9 million barrels (approximately 210 million gallons). Even a decade later, the community and animal habitats affected by this disaster have yet to fully recover.

### Current industry pratice
The common oil spill responses are:

* Chemical dispersion and biological agents:  break down the oil into its chemical constituents
* Buring: aims to remove oils floating on the water
* Natural Dispersal. (oil eventually break down if left alone)

### Our Objectives

In addition to bring more awareness of the harms and impacts of oil spill, we also want to 

* Design a new cost-effective apporach to clean up oil without secondary damage 
* Design a new continuious oil recycling on the ocean
* Collect and establish baseline data and access long-term impact

## Our idea

We all know sponge can absorbing and once pushed, it can be reuse again and again. The idea is to find a material capable of absorbing oil exclusively from water to create a "Super Sponge".  
If such matieral can be found and produced, it could be a game changer for mitigating Oil spills. These are what we are looking for:

* High oil absorption capacity
* Reusability
* Won't case any secondary pollution
* Cost

Next we need to design a continuious recycleing mecanisim to keep these sponges into action. One small sponge can only do so much, but with the right volumn it surely will make a big difference. 
We want to make it as simple as possible to reduce the installion or maintaince cost. Ideally it should be automated so the design will be depolyed without much human intervaetion.
This is also our team's strenths: develop and create a model which can fully unilize the oil absorbing matieral.
