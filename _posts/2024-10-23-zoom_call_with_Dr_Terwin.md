Interview with **Dr Jeff Terwin, Head of La Jolla Day School, Marine Biologist**

What are your most pressing concerns regarding the long-term
effects of oil spills on coastal ecosystems?

~~~
The first issue to concern about is the impact on the food web, as the oil
spill could change the environment. Some non-native species could be introduced
that are invasive and intrusive, because they do not have predators in this
ecosystem. Take zebra mussels as an example – their appearance shifted the
food web and affected the food web to the top. Another piece to concern about is
the toxicity. Are you familiar with the term bio-accumulation? It is the process by
which chemicals build up in an organism over time. Chemicals that bioaccumulate
can build up in the bodies of organisms that can start with plankton but have a
more severe impact on organisms that are higher on the food chain, such as
humans.
~~~

What are the biggest challenges you face in studying
and solving for the impacts of oil spills on marine life and habitats?

~~~
I would say the baseline data. This term means that the data we collect
in the ecosystem in which and when it operates normally, while rule out the factors
such as seasonality. Unfortunately we don’t have a lot of baseline data so we wont
know what might have / haven’t changed. We are trying to encourage some
general study on baseline data. Another point is the cleaning process. Cleaning
could actually do more damage than good.
~~~

Are there any emerging technologies or research areas
that you believe could significantly improve oil spill response and recovery
efforts?

~~~
Yes. One is the study on where the oil is coming from. There are 2
types of oil spills: one is called point source (like the sinking ship with oil) and the
other is called non-point which accounts for ~95%. New technologies have been
developed to figure out where the oil is from. Also, there is now the biological
process which uses bacteria which could decompose the oil residuals and even
plastic. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria are typically used to clean up oil spills.
Pseudomonas putida is a species of Pseudomonas that is often used in
bioremediation to clean up oil spills.

How can our team "Nautilus" contribute to
fostering greater collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and industry
in addressing the challenges posed by oil spills? What specific roles or projects
could we undertake to facilitate partnerships and knowledge sharing while
being realistic?

~~~
Use your student’s voice! You can create videos, slides shows to talk
about the future, how this might impact us and our future generations. There is a

funding called Sea Grant (https://seagrant.noaa.gov/) which is a Federal-
University partnership program that brings science together with communities for

solutions that work. The network draws on the expertise of more than 3,000
scientists, engineers, public outreach experts, educators and students to help
citizens better understand, conserve and utilize America’s coastal resources.
While you are not in college yet, consider how you may be able to work with the
local Sea Grant people. (https://ohioseagrant.osu.edu/ )

What strategies do you think are most effective for raising
public awareness about the dangers of oil spills and promoting sustainable
practices? What specific roles or projects could we undertake to support such
initiatives while being realistic?
(skipped this question as it was answered in the last one)


Do you have any suggestions or ideas in mind as solutions to this
problem?
~~~
I think your project is in unique position here and would suggest to start
with the baseline data. There are many ways to collect baseline data, like courage
people to help collect the data when they are on a vacation visiting the coastal
area. This is also called crowd sourcing. A good example is the bird watching
community where people will share information on when/where to observe the
specific type of bird species. You can consider using a similar approach.
