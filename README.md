Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

You can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.
