<p>Oil spills can occur during extraction, transportation, or when oil-based products spill directly into waterways or from inland storm drains. It is a global issue, with an estimated 1.3 million gallons of oil spilled every year. These spills cause direct harm to animals and ecosystems. Animals may suffer from both direct exposure to the oil and its secondary effects.</p>

<p>Additionally, their habitats are destroyed, leading to recovery times that can last decades. Oil spills also impact local economies and the communities living nearby, resulting in long-term devastation.</p>

<p>The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 is a notable example, with an estimated total discharge of 4.9 million barrels (approximately 210 million gallons). Even a decade later, the community and animal habitats affected by this disaster have yet to fully recover.</p>

<p>Our team conducted the research in the libarary and online. We also reach out to expert to understand the pressing need and impact of the oil spills.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautilusrobot/blog/master/assets/images/post_img/20251_26_post_10.JPG" alt="common pratices" /></p>

<h3 id="common-industry-pratices">Common industry pratices</h3>
<p>The common oil spill responses are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chemical dispersion and biological agents:  break down the oil into its chemical constituents</li>
  <li>Buring: aims to remove oils floating on the water</li>
  <li>Natural Dispersal. (oil eventually break down if left alone)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="our-objectives">Our Objectives</h3>

<p>In addition to bring more awareness of the harms and impacts of oil spill, we also want to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design a new cost-effective apporach to clean up oil without secondary damage</li>
  <li>Design a new continuious oil recycling on the ocean</li>
  <li>Collect and establish baseline data and access long-term impact</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-big-idea">The Big Idea</h2>

<p>We all know that sponges can absorb liquid and can be reused multiple times. The goal is to find a material capable of absorbing oil exclusively from water to create a “Super Sponge.” 
If such a material can be discovered and produced, it could be a game changer in mitigating oil spills. Here are the qualities we are looking for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High oil absorption capacity</li>
  <li>Reusability</li>
  <li>Won’t case any secondary pollution</li>
  <li>Cost</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, we need to design a continuous recycling mechanism to keep these sponges functioning effectively. While a single sponge has its limitations, an adequate volume can certainly make a significant impact. 
Our goal is to make the system as simple as possible to minimize installation and maintenance costs. Ideally, it should be automated to enable deployment with minimal human intervention. 
This aligns with our team’s strengths: developing and creating a model that can fully utilize the oil-absorbing material.</p>

<h3 id="our-experiment-and-module">Our experiment and module</h3>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautilusrobot/blog/master/assets/images/post_img/20251_26_post_8.JPG" alt="Polypropylene" /></p>

<p>We reached out to the experts. Based on their feedbackss, we finalized three different materials for our own experiment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Polypropylene: Polypropylene (PP), also known as polypropene, is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications. It is produced via chain-growth polymerization from the monomer propylene.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautilusrobot/blog/master/assets/images/post_img/20251_26_post_4.JPG" alt="Polypropylene" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Polyester: Polyester is a category of polymers that contain one or two ester linkages in every repeat unit of their main chain.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautilusrobot/blog/master/assets/images/post_img/20251_26_post_5.JPG" alt="Polyester" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Micelle: A micelle is an aggregate (or supramolecular assembly) of surfactant amphipathic lipid molecules dispersed in a liquid, forming a colloidal suspension (also known as associated colloidal system).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautilusrobot/blog/master/assets/images/post_img/20251_26_post_6.JPG" alt="Micelle" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Souce: Chemical defination/diagram come from Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We placed these oil-absorbing and hydrophobic materials in contact with engine oil, vegetable oil, crude oil, and tap water. All of the materials performed reasonably well at absorbing only oil, and the filtered water appeared visually clear. 
The engineered polyester stood out, effectively cleaning up over 50% weight/weight of the oil within 10 minutes.</p>

<p>After the experiment, our team began designing a recycling model that utilizes the engineered polyester belt. 
Our concept is inspired by the tank belt. The rotating mechanism allows for the individual installation of materials. At the end of the device, there is a second roller that physically pushes the oil out of the material.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautilusrobot/blog/master/assets/images/post_img/20251_26_post_3.JPG" alt="model" /></p>

<p>This device can continuously recycle oil and can be installed on boats, floating platforms, or any other stable, flat surfaces. The absorbent belt costs only $10 per kilogram and can be reused up to 10 times before its performance starts to decline.</p>

<p>We built the lego version of the model based on our design. We also confirm with Dr. Dean Wang (Mechanical Engineering, OSU) to make sure this will works in real world.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautilusrobot/blog/master/assets/images/post_img/20251_26_post_7.JPG" alt="Lego" /></p>

<h3 id="lets-talk-about-the-advantages">Let’s talk about the advantages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The material is safe for both the environment and human health, ensuring that it does not lead to any secondary pollution.</li>
  <li>The material is easily recoverable and recyclable, promoting sustainability.</li>
  <li>The oil can be collected and ideally reused, maximizing resource efficiency.</li>
  <li>This kit is compatible with any existing oil platform or cleanup vessel, making it versatile for various applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-step">Next Step</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Enhance roubustness and capacity of absorbent belt</li>
  <li>Improve gyro motor to increase oil recycle efficiency.</li>
  <li>Applyfor patent protection, contract manufacture and commercialize products.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes are capuretred by our team member Abert.</p>

<p>What are your most pressing concerns regarding the long-term
effects of oil spills on coastal ecosystems?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The first issue to concern about is the impact on the food web, as the oil
spill could change the environment. Some non-native species could be introduced
that are invasive and intrusive, because they do not have predators in this
ecosystem. Take zebra mussels as an example – their appearance shifted the
food web and affected the food web to the top. Another piece to concern about is
the toxicity. Are you familiar with the term bio-accumulation? It is the process by
which chemicals build up in an organism over time. Chemicals that bioaccumulate
can build up in the bodies of organisms that can start with plankton but have a
more severe impact on organisms that are higher on the food chain, such as
humans.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What are the biggest challenges you face in studying
and solving for the impacts of oil spills on marine life and habitats?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I would say the baseline data. This term means that the data we collect
in the ecosystem in which and when it operates normally, while rule out the factors
such as seasonality. Unfortunately we don’t have a lot of baseline data so we wont
know what might have / haven’t changed. We are trying to encourage some
general study on baseline data. Another point is the cleaning process. Cleaning
could actually do more damage than good.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Are there any emerging technologies or research areas
that you believe could significantly improve oil spill response and recovery
efforts?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Yes. One is the study on where the oil is coming from. There are 2
types of oil spills: one is called point source (like the sinking ship with oil) and the
other is called non-point which accounts for ~95%. New technologies have been
developed to figure out where the oil is from. Also, there is now the biological
process which uses bacteria which could decompose the oil residuals and even
plastic. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria are typically used to clean up oil spills.
Pseudomonas putida is a species of Pseudomonas that is often used in
bioremediation to clean up oil spills.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How can our team “Nautilus” contribute to
fostering greater collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and industry
in addressing the challenges posed by oil spills? What specific roles or projects
could we undertake to facilitate partnerships and knowledge sharing while
being realistic?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Use your student’s voice! You can create videos, slides shows to talk
about the future, how this might impact us and our future generations. There is a

funding called Sea Grant (https://seagrant.noaa.gov/) which is a Federal-
University partnership program that brings science together with communities for

solutions that work. The network draws on the expertise of more than 3,000
scientists, engineers, public outreach experts, educators and students to help
citizens better understand, conserve and utilize America’s coastal resources.
While you are not in college yet, consider how you may be able to work with the
local Sea Grant people. (https://ohioseagrant.osu.edu/ )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What strategies do you think are most effective for raising
public awareness about the dangers of oil spills and promoting sustainable
practices? What specific roles or projects could we undertake to support such
initiatives while being realistic?
(skipped this question as it was answered in the last one)</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions or ideas in mind as solutions to this
problem?</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I think your project is in unique position here and would suggest to start
with the baseline data. There are many ways to collect baseline data, like courage
people to help collect the data when they are on a vacation visiting the coastal
area. This is also called crowd sourcing. A good example is the bird watching
community where people will share information on when/where to observe the
specific type of bird species. You can consider using a similar approach.
