<table border=”0″>
    <tr>
        <td width="60%">My name is Kevin Feng. I love Internet of things and technology. I use what i learned from youtube to created this website.
            This is the first time for me and most of our crew members. I know it is going to be a fun ride. 
            I plan to use this website to document our full experience of FLL and put what i learned in use.
